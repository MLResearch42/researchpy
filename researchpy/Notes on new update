(1) Added support to summarize for Pandas Groupby objects

(2) Updated difference_test to work with the changes made to summarize

(3) Added -model- which will be the bases on the multivariable analysis

(4) Added -anova- which will conduct an anova and produce 1, 2, or 3 sum of squares

(5) Added signrank test


TO DO
=====
[] Validate:
  <DONE> -summarize-
  <DONE> -difference_test-
  <DONE> -ttest-
  <DONE> -signrank-
  <DONE> -anova-
      <DONE> Validated outcome model with different sum of squares & model effect size.
      <DONE> Want to add variable effect sizes where "r squared" and "r squared adj." currently are
              > Added the calculations to the documentation
      <DONE> finish -regression_table- function
  <> Validate Effect Size Measures

[DONE] Add the new helper functions to Researchpy

[DONE] Add ability to specifiy if one wants to use Welch or Welch-Satterthwaite Degrees of Freedom in
    difference_test and ttest.

[DONE] Add mention to Chatel B (have email) about helping with Welch's

[DONE] Ensure name_cleaner works for formulas using "C(disease, Treatment(value))" where
      disease is the variable name and value is the category which is desired to be the reference


[] Add documentation about:
  <> basic_stats
  <In progress> anova
  <> model
  <> signrank test
