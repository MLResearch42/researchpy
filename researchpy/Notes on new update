py -m pip install -e C:\Users\Corey\Documents\GitHub\researchpy



(1) Added support to summarize for Pandas Groupby objects

(2) Updated difference_test to work with the changes made to summarize

(3) Added -model- which will be the bases on the multivariable analysis

(4) Added -anova- which will conduct an anova and produce 1, 2, or 3 sum of squares

(5) Added signrank test

(6) Added -ols- which conducts linear regression using ordinary least Squares

(7) Added -predict- which conducts various estimations using model information from -anova- or -ols- objects; support for other classes are coming.


TO DO
=====
[DONE] Validate:
  <DONE> -summarize-
  <DONE> -difference_test-
  <DONE> -ttest-
  <DONE> -signrank-
  <DONE> -anova-
      <DONE> Validated outcome model with different sum of squares & model effect size.
      <DONE> Want to add variable effect sizes where "r squared" and "r squared adj." currently are
              > Added the calculations to the documentation
      <DONE> finish -regression_table- function

  <DONE> Validate Effect Size Measures
    <DONE> difference_test
    <DONE> ttest
    <DONE> ANOVA
        (DONE) R, R^2, Eta^2, Partial Eta^2, Epsilon^2, and Omega^2 are perfect matches
          (DONE) Partial Epsilon^2 and Omega^2 doesn't match Stata -> Stata 17 uses the F-statistic rather than the formulas from Olejnik and Algina (2000)

[DONE] Add the new helper functions to Researchpy

[DONE] Add ability to specifiy if one wants to use Welch or Welch-Satterthwaite Degrees of Freedom in
    difference_test and ttest.

[DONE] Add mention to Chatel B (have email) about helping with Welch's

[DONE] Ensure name_cleaner works for formulas using "C(disease, Treatment(value))" where
      disease is the variable name and value is the category which is desired to be the reference


[DONE] ANOVA -regression_table()- output has something funky going on
        > Fixed, had to update the variable_information function


[] Add documentation about:
  <> basic_stats
  <DONE> anova
  <> model
  <DONE> signrank test
  <DONE> summarize
  <STARTED> predict
  <> ols
